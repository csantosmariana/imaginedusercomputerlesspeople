Who is exactly a user? How does the ever-changing user paradigm reshape post-internet? Is post-internet shaped? Does post-internet fail to represent the present? Imagined User: “Computerless” People answer these questions exploring the user paradigm and how it has influenced to shape post-internet at a time when the digital world fails to represent the present.
While we can describe a user being a person who uses or operates something when looking through the post-internet context, we imagine users as “computerless” people living in a time ‘after’ the internet, where the interaction between person and machine no longer exits.
Imagined User: “Computerless” People thus deconstructs what exactly is a user, revealing a time when: “There was no ‘after’ the internet, only during, during, during.”<sup>2</sup>, when the internet transformed itself in a medium and the user’s rights led to a phenomena of circulation that revolutionized post-internet.

The film is mostly set inside a computer network; programs, represented by actors in glowing costumes, are the main heroes. One program asks another: “You believe in the users?” The other answers: “Yes, sure. If I don’t have a user, then who wrote me?” In another conversation it becomes clear that both an account manager and a hacker are called “user” by “their” programs."</p>

This condition is espoused in the writings of Nicolas Bourriaud as “constructing archipelagoes... a voluntary grouping of islands networked together to create autonomous entities” as a means of proclaiming that “the universalist and progressive dream that governed modern times is in tatters."</p>

Through this comparison, I want to suggest that the internet’s growth in recent years—steadily reaching more people, in more places, for more time in the day, performing more functions than ever before—has prompted artists to constantly renegotiate their critical positions. Even the term ‘post-internet’ itself has been redefined and changed; it has come to stand less for a clear demarcation of ‘before’ and ‘after’ than to represent a continuously evolving critical dialogue."</p>
